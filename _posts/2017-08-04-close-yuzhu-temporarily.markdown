### I need shut down yuzhu.me for about 5-30 day. not sure.     
don't worry, it just temporarily.      
not because the product suck & doesn't make money & cost me a lot money.  
it just because government told me to. 

I just got a call this afternoon from gov, tell me to "备案" my website, and before it's done, I should shut it down temporarily.  
it just policy, everyone is doing it, I am not special.  


### in China there are a special thing call "备案"     
（I guess "filing" is appropriate translation ?）    
it mean I have to submit to gov about:    
<br/>

* who I am (by submit ID card number & photo) (it's like the SSN number in U.S.)
* what is the domain name, 
* phone number 
* email 
* what I am gonna do (game? education? travel-relate product?)
* home address or office address, 
* etc..    

and it's not just type these thing into a form and done. not something that take 5 minute.     

I have to take photo of myself too.   
the entire process would take about 5 day to a month. they would review all the document I submit.      
and the mean time, I have to close website (by delete DNS A record )

### yep, pretty frustrating,       
and it's not about server provider or domain register,    
I am using NameCheap and UCloud (you can think of UCloud as China AWS)   
even I use Digital Ocean/Linode/AWS + Namecheap/Godaddy/domain.com   

gov would still try to contact me and tell me fill the form,    
if they can't contact me or I just refused to fill the form,  
they would just block the website.   
unless you use Proxy, otherwise you can't visit it directly in China.    

### that's it, this post just an annocement.
I think most people doesn't know such thing exist in China, that's why I wrote this post.  
it's quite annoying and not "startup-friendly", it just slow down the company by 5-30 day.

Have a nice day! Thanks for reading.
:D

### oh, right, let me write a quick update about yuzhu.me  
it's about a month now (July, 11 - August, 4), total visitor is ~3k .    

I am adding map, forum, chat room, and review, I don't want get too much attation.    
because right now it's still relatively simple website, other people can clone it within couple day. 


so after first couple day I did some marketing, I didn't do any marketing after that.  
so 3k is kind of OK.  

 
the feedback I get from people is awesome, they like it a lot.(not sure how much they willing to pay for it)  
I am still trying to provide more value before think of a way to make money, to monetize. 

that's it.
