I think these are pretty fun, so I film some video with my phone,  
I didn't wrote any script beforehand, I have 0 experience in video editing/film making/vlog.  


I am still edting it, trying to make it fun & short.     
basically it just me walking around these place,  
after watch these video you would know where it is, and how's the inside look like.  
it just show how the startup environment look like in GuangZhou.    

it's not like Casey Neistat talk to camera, I wouln't appear in video at all.
